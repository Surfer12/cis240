Let me help explain the mathematical notation you're asking about.

<understanding>
This is the summation symbol (Σ), which represents the sum of a sequence of values. In the formula shown:

```
value(number₁₀) = Σ(i=0 to m) symbol_value(dⁱ) × 10ⁱ
```

This formula is calculating the decimal value of a number by summing up each digit multiplied by its place value.

<analysis>
Let's break down the components:
- Σ indicates we're adding up multiple terms
- i=0 is the starting point
- m is the ending point (number of digits minus 1)
- symbol_value(dⁱ) represents the value of each digit
- 10ⁱ represents the place value (1s, 10s, 100s, etc.)
</analysis>

<example>
For instance, let's take the number 234:
- When i=0: 4 × 10⁰ = 4 × 1 = 4 (ones place)
- When i=1: 3 × 10¹ = 3 × 10 = 30 (tens place)  
- When i=2: 2 × 10² = 2 × 100 = 200 (hundreds place)

The sum 200 + 30 + 4 = 234 gives us our final value.

This notation is commonly used in mathematics and computer science to represent iterative calculations in a concise way. It's particularly useful when describing number systems and place-value notation.
